    In JavaScript functions are considered objects. This means we can treat them like objects. 
    Callback functions are functions that are passed through other functions.

<h2>Functions as Parameters</h2>

<p>
    Here we use <code>add</code> as a callback function. It is declared in the parameters, and executed 
    as part of <code>useNumbers</code>. Although this does demonstrate the callback functions, this example 
    doesn't really make sense, since there is no need to use a callback function here.
</p>

<h2>Why Use Callbacks?</h2>
<p>
    The main reason to use callback functions, it to prevent blocking. JavaScript is inherently 
    a single threaded language, and when a process doesn't let anything else happen until it is 
    finished, it is blocking. A common function that blocks is the <code>alert</code> function. It requires 
    user input before it will let any other processes run. Callback functions wait for the 
    function calling it to complete before executing in the main thread, so we can prevent blocking 
    by using them.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    Whenever we pass a function as a parameter of another function, we are using callbacks. 
    These are mainly used to prevent blocking and make our programs asynchronous.
