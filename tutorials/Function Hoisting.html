<p>
    Function hoisting is the JavaScript paradigm where function and 
    variable declarations move to the top of the current scope at runtime. 
    Before we can understand this, we need to understand how scope works in JavaScript.
</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>
    Functions create scope in JavaScript, so whenever you declare a new function, 
    you are creating a new scope.

<p>
    In this example we have three scopes. Scope A is the global scope. Scope B 
    is created when we declare the <code>doSomething</code> function. Then we have Scope 
    C which is created when we declare the <code>doSomethingElse</code> function. Scopes 
    can access other scopes as long as their function is within that Scope.

<p>
    Scope A cannot access Scope B and Scope C. Scope B cannot access Scope C. Scopes 
    can only access items in their scope, and in outer scopes. They cannot access in inner scopes.

<h2>Function Hoisting</h2>

<p>
    As you can see, <code>doSomethingElse</code> is called at the beginning of 
    <code>doSomething</code> before it is declared. It still runs, because <code>doSomethingElse</code> 
    had it's declaration moved to the top at runtime. This is function hoisting.
</p>

<h2>Declarations and Assignments</h2>
<p>
    Only declarations are moved to the top. If a declaration is on the same line as 
    an assignment, the assignments still acts as it would without being moved to the top.

<p>
    <code>variableA</code> is called before it is declared, but still returns a value 
    of <code>undefined</code>. If it didn't exist, this would have instead produced an error 
    and the code would not run. That shows the decaration did ove to the top, but the assignment 
    of <code>true</code> did not run until the line it was made.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    Although it is important to understand how function hoisting works, it 
    is still best practice to make our function declarations at the top. We want to make 
    our code readable, and don’t want to organize it in a way that is unintuitive.
