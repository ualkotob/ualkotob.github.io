    Two way data binding is when you have an element in the UI that is updated 
    by an object in the script. Then, when the UI is updated, the object is 
    also updated.

<h2>AngularJS Example</h2>
<iframe height='238' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/ualkotob/embed/LRYwqP/?height=238&theme-id=dark&default-tab=html,result&embed-version=2' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/ualkotob/pen/LRYwqP/'>Two Way Data Binding: Example</a> by Umar Alkotob (<a href='http://codepen.io/ualkotob'>@ualkotob</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.

    In AngularJS, two way databinding is a built in feature. In the example 
    above we created the <code>testData</code> variable in the scope. We then used <code>ng-model</code> 
    to bind it to the input box. This makes it bound to the variable, and change it when we 
    type something in the box. To make sure this is a two way bind, we display <code>testData</code> 
    below the box as well using the angular expression <code>{{testData}}</code>. It also updates when 
    we change the test in the input box. As we can see, it is working as intended.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    Two way data binding is a useful tool. By using it correctly, we can create more responsive 
    and user friendly web applications.
