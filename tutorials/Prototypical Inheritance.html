<p>    
    Before talking about prototypal inheritance, we need to talk about how JavaScript is 
    different from other object oriented programming languages. While other languages, 
    like C# and Visual Basic, use what we know as classes, JavaScript uses objects. 
</p>

<h2>What is an Object?</h2>
<p>
    An object is a variable that holds other named variables. See our <code>person</code> object below.
</p>

<p>
    As you can see, out <code>person</code> object holds two variables in <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> which 
    are referred to as properties. Objects can also hold functions, which are referred to as methods. 
    With that out of the way we can talk about inheritance.
</p>

<h2>Inheritance in JavaScript</h2>
<p>
    In JavaScript, inheritance is when one object inherits the properties/methods of another object.
     We will call is a child parent relationship. The child object takes all of the properties and methods 
    of the parent object, unless it already has them. See the example below.
</p>

<p>
    We use the <code>__proto__</code> property here to have <code>student</code> inherit <code>person</code>. The <code>student</code> object has its 
    own <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code>, so those are not taken from <code>person</code>. It takes the <code>greet</code> method, 
    since that does not exist in <code>student</code>. Lastly is keeps its own <code>major</code> property.
</p>

<h2>Checking If a Property Exists In the Parent or Child</h2>
<p>
    Sometimes you might want to check whether the property was inherited or not. 
    In this case, you can use <code>hasOwnProperty</code> as shown below.
</p>

<h2>Classical Inheritance vs Prototypal Inheritance</h2>
<p>
    The paradigm of inheriting from objects is fundamentally different from inheriting 
    from classes. We can think of classes as more of a template for creating objects. 
    They do not function on their own, and cannot be invoked without being instantiated in an object. 
    When we use objects for inheritance, the parent object is always accessible directly, and the values can 
    be changed after runtime. 
</p>

<h2>Different Syntax and Browser Compatibility</h2>
<p>
    The <code>__proto__</code> syntax we used above only works in Firefox and Google Chrome. For compatibility 
    with most browsers, we need to use different syntax.
</p>
<iframe height='458' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/ualkotob/embed/BLaddp/?height=458&theme-id=dark&default-tab=js,result&embed-version=2' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/ualkotob/pen/BLaddp/'>Prototypical Inheritance: Object.create() Example</a> by Umar Alkotob (<a href='http://codepen.io/ualkotob'>@ualkotob</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>
<p>
We can use <code>Object.create</code> to create an copy of the <code>person</code> object. What makes this different than using <code>__proto__</code> is 
    that you cannot give <code>student</code> is that you need to give it custom properties after inheritence. Ify ou do it before, it will be lost when 
    <code>person</code> is copied.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    When dealing with prototypical inheritance in JavaScript, it's imported to remember it's not interchangeable with class inheritance. 
    We also need to careful of the syntax we use, to make sure we have the most compatibility. If we can keep that in mind, we can avoid 
    mistakes and confusion in our code.
