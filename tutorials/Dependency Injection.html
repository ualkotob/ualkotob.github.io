    Dependency injection is the practice of putting all of a functions dependency's in its parameters. 
    The makes it clear what data the function is using when we call it, everything it uses needs to be 
    passed in.

<h2>Converting a Function</h2>

    This function doesn't use dependency injection. As we can see, the function calls on the variable <code>name</code> 
    when it prints to the console. <code>name</code> is a dependency, since it will not function without that variable. 
    For dependency injection, we need to pass dependency's as parameters.

    Now <code>name</code> is instead a parameter in the function. <code>sayName</code> no longer has any external dependencies. 
    This is a very simple example, but you can see how to make sure your function has all its dependencies 
    in its parameters.

<h2>Why Use Dependency Injection?</h2>
<p>
    Although designing your functions this way can make them more flexible, the main reason it is used is 
    for testing. When a function has external dependencies, it can be a nightmare to test. When it throws 
    an error, you can't be sure if there is something wrong with the function, or one of its dependencies. 
    When all dependencies are in the parameters, you can use dummy data for testing, so you can reduce issues. 
    This is often done using XML to test functions and find out if it can deal with every situation required of it.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    We can use dependency injection to make our functions easier to debug. It can also help with testing 
    different data from external sources.
